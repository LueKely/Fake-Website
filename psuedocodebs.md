for the information notificiation i want it stored in an array and be in in its component and be export to app
might as well use slots
when an event is successful such as delete/create i want to push a set of data with it's type of notification if it is a warning or a success and then push it into the array and after you push then it make a settime function to remove it

must also export a function that will req the type of notification only add it in the async functions

# styling

# displaying the array

- use for each with a key and shit
